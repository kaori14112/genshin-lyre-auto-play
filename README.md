A script for playing "The Poems of Wind" according to the midi file. Driven by python.

## The operating environment

```
Windows
python 3.x
pywin32 （Used to simulate keyboard input ）
```

When the python environment is configured, install the module using the pip install pywin32 numpy command.

## Instructions

For users who have not been exposed to relevant content, you can use the exe file packaged by @shadlc: [download link](https://github.com/Misaka17032/genshin-lyre-auto-play/releases/download/V1.0/piano.exe)

Drag and drop the midi file directly on top of the file to start.

Put the score into a folder named `songs`, and make sure that the notes in the midi file are in the center C and two octaves of white keys up and down.

Double-click run.bat or run `python piano.py` with administrator privileges

Follow the prompts to enter the midi file name (not including the suffix, that is, `.mid`) and the sleeping time (ie, wait a few seconds to start playing).

Be sure to switch back to the in-game page before starting to play, and stay in the game during the performance.
